# South Sister - Central Oregon
\\
Around May 15th, the Sierra weather forecast was looking dismal. Warmer temps throughout the night
would not allow for a refreeze, creating the possibility for wet loose avalanches, and more importantly
no **corn snow!!!** Our eyes looked to the North for better temps, and eventually Dylan and I decided to climb
and splitboard the south ridge route of South Sister in Central Oregon.

## Bend and Devils Lake
