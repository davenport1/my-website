# Mt Shasta - Northern California - Avalanche Gulch
\
\
After failing on my first attempt at Mt Shasta, and my first real mountaineering climb, 2 months earlier,
I returned to Mt Shasta with a good school buddy of mine Dylan, and Nat, whom I had met on the mountain
during my first attempt and made a vow with that we would return and gain the summit of this epic cascade peak in
Northern California.
